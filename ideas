sms.contact_map NO

sms.spherical.cluster
 ... report cluster_sizes, cluster_ids (can work out the unimers by finding the symmetric difference = union - intersection)

sms.spherical.intrinsic_density
 ... report spherical (with check for main micelle), planar, spherical cluster (could do a fixed size version too)
  ... needs to return core radius, profiles, coordination number


sms.spherical.internal_relaxtion 
     ... report time series...

sms.spherical.profile
 ... report time series of position of molecule(s)

sms.spherical.radius_of_gyration
  .. for largest micelle or clusters

sms.spherical.hydrodynamic_radius
 .. same as rog

sms.spherical.eccentricity
 .. same as rog

sms.spherical.mobility


sms.spherical.tracking



sms.planar.intrinsic_density

 ...this can then be combined with any normal calculation in mda to give intrinsic profiles, etc

or...

sms.planar.intrinsic_profile
...give two time series of a intrinsic positions and associated quantity...
