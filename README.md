# pySoftWhere: A Python Package for Intrinsic Interface Analysis of Simulated Soft Matter Nanostructures

pySoftWhere (pySW) has the following classes:

1. ICSI (Intrinsic Core-Shell Interface): an algorithm for calculating the core-shell interface of polymer (or surfactant, etc.) micelles
2. IPI (Intrinsic Planar Interface): an algorithm for calculating the interface between a monolayer (or bilayer, polymer slab, etc.) and surrounding solvent (or secondary phase)
3. Clustering: algorithms to find the the distribution of clusters and largest cluster in a simulation. Also contains a robust micelle unwrapping code.
